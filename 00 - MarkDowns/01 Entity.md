**Entity Class**: An entity class is a Java class annotated with @Entity. This class represents a row in a table in the database. Each instance of the entity class corresponds to a record in the table.

**Mapping**: Fields in the entity class are mapped to columns in the database table. This mapping is often done using annotations like @Column, @Id, and others.

**Field**: variables.
